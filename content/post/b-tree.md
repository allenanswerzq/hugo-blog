#### Definition of B-tree
A B-tree T is a rooted tree having following properies:
1. Every node x has the following attributes:
  > (a. x.n, the number of keys currently stored in node x,
  > (b. the x.n keys themselves, x.key1, x.key2, ... x.keyx.n, stored in nondecreasing order, so that x.key1 <= x.key2 <= ... <= x.keyx.n,
  > (c. x.leaf, a boolean value that is TRUE if x is a leaf and FALSE if x is an internal node.

2. Each internal node x also contains x.n + 1 pointers x.C1, x.C2, ..., x.Cx.n+1 to its children. Leaf nodes have no children, and so their ci attributes are undefined.

3. The keys x:keyi separate the ranges of keys stored in each subtree: if ki is any key stored in the subtree with root x:ci, then k1 ! x:key1 ! k2 ! x:key2 ! "" " ! x:keyx: n ! kx: nC1 :

4. All leaves have the same depth, which is the treeâ€™s height h.

5. Nodes have lower and upper bounds on the number of keys they can contain. We express these bounds in terms of a fixed integer t % 2 called the minimum degree of the B-tree:
  a. Every node other than the root must have at least t $ 1 keys. Every internal
  node other than the root thus has at least t children. If the tree is nonempty,
  the root must have at least one key.
  b. Every node may contain at most 2t $ 1 keys. Therefore, an internal node
  may have at most 2t children. We say that a node is full if it contains exactly
